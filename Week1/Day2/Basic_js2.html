    <!-- 1. What is JavaScript and How It Works?
JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to create dynamic web pages. 
It runs in web browsers and allows interaction with HTML and CSS. JavaScript works by being executed 
by the browser's JavaScript engine .
It follows an event-driven, single-threaded, non-blocking execution model using an event loop.

2. Different Ways to Declare JavaScript Variables and Their Differences
JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

Keyword	Scope	          Hoisting	                         Reassignable?	Mutable?
var	Function-scoped	      Hoisted (initialized as undefined)	Yes	         Yes
let	Block-scoped	      Hoisted (but not initialized)	        Yes	         Yes
const	Block-scoped	  Hoisted (but not initialized)	        No	         Yes
Differences
var is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
let and const are block-scoped and cannot be redeclared within the same block.
const must be initialized at declaration and cannot be reassigned.

3. Operators in JavaScript
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Types of Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Comparison Operators: ==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Ternary Operator: condition ? value1 : value2

4. If-Else and Looping Statements in JavaScript
If-Else Statement

let num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    console.log("Number is greater than 5");
} else {
    console.log("Number is 5 or less");
}
Looping Statements
For Loop

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
While Loop

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
Do-While Loop

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
For-in Loop (for objects)

let person = { name: "John", age: 25 };
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]);
}
For-of Loop (for arrays & iterables)

let numbers = [10, 20, 30];
for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}

5. What are Functions in JavaScript?
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

Types of Functions
Function Declaration

function greet() {
    return "Hello!";
}
Function Expression

let greet = function() {
    return "Hello!";
};
Arrow Function (ES6)

let greet = () => "Hello!";
